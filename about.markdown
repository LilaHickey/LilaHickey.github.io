I am a software developer specializing in UI development, but sometimes I can't resist the urge to pull on the end of a string and follow it deep into the stack.

I get excited about git and functional programming, dutifully read my iTerm tip every day, and will probably never care about cryptocurrency. 

For short-form musings on software development (and a lot of other things) you can [find me on Twitter].  

Most of my work is closed-source, so I don't maintain much of a GitHub presence, but you can [find it here].
