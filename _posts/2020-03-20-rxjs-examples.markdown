RxJS operators confuse a lot of us.  I put together some practical examples, that might feel a bit more real than marbles, or contrived interval timers :)


**switchMap**: Your aunt said she'd help with your homework, but the first problem is about how many cupcakes would fit in the moon, and that reminds her
that it's your little cousin's turn to take treats to school.  She has to _switch_ focus and go bake cookies instead of helping you. You give up on your
homework for now.

**flatMap/mergeMap**: You and your little cousin **both** need help getting ready for school. First, you ask your dad tie your shoes. Then your cousin asks your dad to pack her lunch.  Then you ask your dad for help finishing your homework from last night. Then your cousin asks him to sign a permission slip for a field trip to the aquarium. Finally the bus arrives, and you and your cousin head off to school with everything you need. Your dad collapses _flat_ on the floor in exhaustion.

**exhaustMap**: Your baby brother is teething, and will NOT stop crying.  Your mom (who is _exhausted_) can't even acknowledge requests from the rest of the family until she gets your brother to sleep. 

**concatMap**: You and your older sister both need some things before school in the morning; your dad tells you he has to do all her things first, because she has to catch an earlier bus. HE gives her money for lunch, makes sure she has bus fare, and double-checks her algebra homework. You wait patiently, playing with your stuffed kitten (a _con cat_, if you will). After your sister leaves, your dad double-checks your homework, makes you a sandwich, and helps find your missing shoe.
